= Handlers In Depth =
Daniel Higginbotham


This guide explains how https://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/[Liberator] works and how Sweet Tooth uses it to
create request handlers. It explains how to write handlers for your own apps.

It begins with a high-level discussion of the core Liberator concepts
_decisions_ and _context_. It then provides practical guidance on creating
handlers in Sweet Tooth apps.


== Liberator Basics: Decisions ==
TODO contextualize that handlers are functions that take a request and return a
response

By default, Sweet Tooth uses Liberator to construct request handlers. Liberator
provides an abstraction for the common decisions that a request handler has to
make, decisions like: Is this data valid? If not, return a 400 status. Is the
user authorized? If not, return a 401 status. The following two snippets
demonstrate two different approaches I've seen to handling this kind of logic
within the common use-case of creating a new resource:

[source,clojure]
.typical endpoint code
----
(defn create-todo
  [{:keys [params session] :as _req}]
  (if-not (authorized? session)
    (throw NotAuthorized "you do not have permission to do that"))
  (if-let [errors (validation-errors ::create-todo params)]
    {:status 400
     :body   {:errors errors}}
    (create-todo! params)))

(defn create-todo
  [{:keys [params session] :as _req}]
  (cond (not (authorized? session))
        {:status 401
         :body   {:errors "not authorized"}}

        (not (valid? ::create-todo params))
        {:status 400
         :body   {:errors (validation-errors ::create-todo params)}}

        :else
        (create-todo! params)))
----

The structure of this if/then logic to determine which status to return is
always ways the same. You'll always want to check whether the user is authorized
before attempting to validate data, and you'll always want to validate data
before attempting to insert it in a db. You can visualize this structure as a
_decision graph_:

image::decision-graph.png[diagram of a decision graph]

Liberator provides a function that captures the the decision graph -- the order
that the decisions are traversed and the status codes associated with each final
state -- so that your code only has to focus on the logic specific to each
decision.

Below is a simplified version of that function. It takes a map of decision
functions and returns a request handler which can be used to return responses
for ring requests.

TODO explain why it uses `:malformed?` and `:handle-ok` rather than `:valid?`
and `:success?`

[source,clojure]
.simplified decision request generator
----
(def decision-graph
  {:authorized? {true  :malformed?
                 false 401}
   :malformed?  {true  400
                 false :handle-ok}
   :handle-ok   200})

(defn decisions->handler
  [decision-nodes]
  (fn request-handler [req]
    (loop [node :authorized?]
      (let [result              ((node decision-nodes) req)
            edges-or-status     (node decision-graph)
            next-node-or-status (get edges-or-status (boolean result) edges-or-status)]
        (if (keyword? next-node-or-status)
          (recur next-node-or-status) ;; it was a node; on to the next decision!
          {:status next-node-or-status
           :body   result})))))
----

The code might be a little dense and I welcome suggestions for something simpler
or clearer :) `decisions->handler` returns a function that traverses
`decision-graph`, starting with the `:authorized?` node. As it traverses the
graph, it looks up decision functions in the `decision-nodes` argument. It uses
the return value of the decision function to retrieve either the next decision
node or the response status. If a status is retrieved, the function returns.

Here's how you would call this function to create a handler:

[source,clojure]
.Liberator decisions
----
(def create-todo
  (decisions->handler
   {:authorized? el/authenticated?
    :malformed?  (el/validate-describe v/todo-rules)
    :post!       ed/create->:result
    :handle-ok   el/created-pull}))

* include example requests with ring mock
* function that takes a request and returns a response
* liberator decisions

** defaults
** separating methods
