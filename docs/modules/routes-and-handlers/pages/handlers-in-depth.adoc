= Handlers In Depth =
Daniel Higginbotham


This guide explains how https://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/[Liberator] works and how Sweet Tooth uses it to
create request handlers. It explains how to write handlers for your own apps.

It begins with a high-level discussion of the core Liberator concepts
_decisions_ and _context_. It then provides practical guidance on creating
handlers in Sweet Tooth apps.


== Liberator Decisions ==
By default, Sweet Tooth uses Liberator to construct request handlers. Liberator
provides an abstraction for the common decisions that a request handler has to
make, decisions like: Is this data valid? If not, return a 400 status. Is the
user authorized? If not, return a 401 status. The following two snippets
demonstrate two different approaches I've seen to handling this kind of logic
within the common use-case of creating a new resource:

[source,clojure]
.typical endpoint code
----
(defn create-todo
  [{:keys [params session] :as _req}]
  (if-not (authorized? session)
    (throw NotAuthorized "you do not have permission to do that"))
  (if-let [errors (validation-errors ::create-todo params)]
    {:status 400
     :body   {:errors errors}}
    (create-todo! params)))

(defn create-todo
  [{:keys [params session] :as _req}]
  (cond (not (authorized? session))
        {:status 401
         :body   {:errors "not authorized"}}

        (not (valid? ::create-todo params))
        {:status 400
         :body   {:errors (validation-errors ::create-todo params)}}

        :else
        (create-todo! params)))
----

The structure of this if/then logic to determine which status to return is
always ways the same. You'll always want to check whether the user is authorized
before attempting to validate data, and you'll always want to validate data
before attempting to insert it in a db. If the request isn't authorized, you
should always return a 401 status, and if it's not valid you should return a 400
status. You can visualize this structure as a _decision graph_:

image::decision-graph.png[diagram of a decision graph]

Liberator provides a function that captures the the decision graph -- the order
that the decisions are traversed and the status codes associated with each final
result -- so that your code only has to focus on the logic specific to each
decision.

Below is a simplified version of that function. It takes a map of decision
functions and returns a request handler which can be used to return responses
for ring requests.

NOTE: Liberator uses `:malformed?` instead of `:valid?` and `:handle-ok` instead
of `:success` because it's actually structuring decisions regarding how to
return a valid HTTP response, and the language of `malformed` and `ok` hews more
closely to the HTTP spec.

[source,clojure]
.simplified decision request generator
----
(def decision-graph
  {:authorized? {true  :malformed?
                 false 401}
   :malformed?  {true  400
                 false :handle-ok}
   :handle-ok   200})

(defn decisions->handler
  [decision-nodes]
  (fn request-handler [req]
    (loop [node :authorized?]
      (let [result              ((node decision-nodes) req)
            edges-or-status     (node decision-graph)
            next-node-or-status (get edges-or-status (boolean result) edges-or-status)]
        (if (keyword? next-node-or-status)
          (recur next-node-or-status) ;; it was a node; on to the next decision!
          {:status next-node-or-status
           :body   result})))))
----

The code might be a little dense and I welcome suggestions clearer :)
`decisions->handler` returns a function that traverses `decision-graph`,
starting with the `:authorized?` node. As it traverses the graph, it looks up
decision functions in `decision-nodes`. It uses the return value of the decision
function to retrieve either the next decision node or the response status. If a
status is retrieved, the function returns.

Here's how you would call this function to create a handler:

[source,clojure]
.create and call a handler
----
(def handler (decisions->handler {:authorized? (constantly true)
                                  :malformed? (constantly false)
                                  :handle-ok (constantly "hi")}))

(handler {})
;; =>
{:status 200, body "hi"}
----

[NOTE]
====

The simplified Liberator re-implementation differs from actual Liberator in a
couple important ways. First, the real library provides sane defaults for
`:authorized?`, `:malformed?` and all the rest of its decision functions. I
didn't include default handling in these examples to keep the code more focused.

Second, Liberator allows you to provide constants, so you can write
`:authorized? true` instead of `:authorized? (constantly true)` and `:handle-ok
"hi"` instead of `:handle-ok (constantly "hi"))`.

====


== Liberator Context ==
The above examples are incomplete: Liberator actually allows you to convey data
from decision function to the next. For example, in the `:authorized?` decision
you might look up the identity associated with a request. The `:handle-ok`
function could use this data; rather than looking it up again, `:authorized?`
can store it so that `:handle-ok` can access it.

Liberator accomplishes this by passing the request _context_ in to each decision
function. A Liberator context is just a map. It includes the ring request under
the key `:request`. Your decision functions can append to the context by
returning a vector like so:

[source,clojure]
.append to a context
----
(defn authorized?
  [ctx]
  (when-let [user (find-user ctx)]
    [true {:auth-user user}]))
----

The first element of the vector, `true`, is the decision result, and it
determines which node of the decision graph to visit next. The second element,
`{:auth-user user}`, is a map that gets merged into context. The updated context
is available to downstream decision handlers:

[source,clojure]
.create and call a handler
----
(defn handle-ok
  [ctx]
  (create-todo! (merge (get-in ctx [:request :params])
                       {:user-id (get-in ctx [:auth-user :id])})))
----

Here's an updated version of the `decisions->handler` function that implements
this feature, along with a toy handler that makes use of it:

[source,clojure]
.decisions->handler with context
----
(defn conform-decision-result
  [result]
  (if (vector? result)
    result
    [result {}]))

(defn decisions->handler
  [decision-nodes]
  (fn [req]
    (loop [ctx  {:request req}
           node :authorized?]
      (let [[result added-context] (conform-decision-result ((node decision-nodes) ctx))
            edges-or-status        (node decision-graph)
            next-node-or-status    (get edges-or-status (boolean result) edges-or-status)]
        (if (keyword? next-node-or-status)
          (recur (merge ctx added-context) next-node-or-status) ;; it was a node; on to the next decision!
          {:status next-node-or-status
           :body   result})))))

(def handler
  (decisions->handler
   {:authorized? (fn [ctx] [true {:auth-user {:user-id 1}}])
    :malformed?  (constantly false)
    :handle-ok   (fn [ctx] (str "Logged in as " (get-in ctx [:auth-user :user-id])))}))

(handler {})
;; =>
"Logged in as 1"
----


== Liberator Decision Functions vs Status Handlers ==
So far I've been conflating _decision functions_ and _status handlers_ under the
perhaps misguided notion that it would allow us to focus on one facet of
Liberator at a time. Let's correct that now.

While decision functions are used to determine which HTTP status code to return
for a request, status handlers determine the response body. Status handlers are
leave nodes in the decision graph. `:handle-ok` is one such function, but
Liberator also makes use of `:handle-malformed`, `:handle-unauthorized`, and
http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/doc/handlers.html[dozens more]. A more accurate decision graph would look like this:

image::decision-and-handler-graph.png[more accurate decision graph]

Let's update our example code to capture this distinction and add
`:handle-malformed` and `:handle-unauthorized` handlers:

[source,clojure]
.decisions->handler with context
----
(def decision-graph
  {:authorized?         {true  :malformed?
                         false :handle-unauthorized}
   :malformed?          {true  :handle-malformed
                         false :handle-ok}
   :handle-unauthorized 401
   :handle-malformed    400
   :handle-ok           200})

(defn decisions->handler
  [decision-nodes]
  (fn [req]
    (loop [ctx  {:request req}
           node :authorized?]
      (let [edges-or-status (node decision-graph)
            node-type       (if (map? edges-or-status)
                                  :decision
                                  :status-handler)]
        (case node-type
          :decision (let [[result added-context] (conform-decision-result ((node decision-nodes) ctx))
                          next-node              (get edges-or-status (boolean result))]
                      (recur (merge ctx added-context) next-node))
          :status   {:status edges-or-status
                     :body   ((node decision-nodes (constantly nil)) ctx)})))))
----

Here's a more realistic example of how this could all work together. First we
create a handler, then we call it with a couple different "requests":

[source,clojure]
.more detailed decisions
----
(def create-todo-list-handler
  (decisions->handler
   {:authorized?      (fn [ctx]
                        (when-let [user (get-in ctx [:request :user])]
                          [true {:user user}]))
    :malformed?       (fn [ctx]
                        (if (get-in ctx [:request :params :todo-list/title])
                          false
                          [true {:errors ["No to-do list title"]}]))
    :handle-malformed (fn [ctx] (select-keys ctx [:errors]))
    :handle-ok        (fn [ctx]
                        (merge (get-in ctx [:request :params])
                               {:todo-list/owner (get-in ctx [:user :id])}))}))

(create-todo-list-handler {:user {:id 1}})
;; =>
{:status 400, :body {:errors ["No to-do list title"]}}


(create-todo-list-handler
 {:user   {:id 1}
  :params {:todo-list/title "write some docs this is your life now"}})
;; =>
{:status 200
 :body #:todo-list{:title "write some docs this is your life now"
                   :owner 1}}
----


== Sweet Tooth handlers ==
Sweet Tooth uses Liberator to create request handlers from decision maps.
Sweet Tooth's approach differs from vanilla liberator in a few key ways:

* It simplifies dispatching by request method (:get, :post, etc)
* It uses an opinionated set of decision functions and status handlers
* It's meant to be used with Integrant, and it provides tools to make that easy
* It introduces some automatic formatting


=== Simpler HTTP method dispatching ===
In vanilla Liberator, you typically create a single handler for a given route.
From http://clojure-liberator.github.io/liberator/tutorial/all-together.html[Liberator's docs]:

[source,clojure]
.vanilla liberator
----
;; create and list entries
(defresource list-resource
  :available-media-types ["application/json"]
  :allowed-methods [:get :post]
  :known-content-type? #(check-content-type % ["application/json"])
  :malformed? #(parse-json % ::data)
  :post! #(let [id (str (inc (rand-int 100000)))]
            (dosync (alter entries assoc id (::data %)))
            {::id id})
  :post-redirect? true
  :location #(build-entry-url (get % :request) (get % ::id))
  :handle-ok #(map (fn [id] (str (build-entry-url (get % :request) id)))
                   (keys @entries)))
----

In this snippet, `defresource` is a Liberator macro that creates a request
handler function, `list-resource`, from the given decision key/value pairs. From
`:allowed-methods`, you can see that it handles both `:get` and `:post`
requests.

I personally find it confusing to combine two different workflows within the
same function like this. In Sweet Tooth, the decision maps used to generate
handlers look like this:

[source,clojure]
.example Sweet Tooth decisions, taken from https://github.com/sweet-tooth-clojure/todo-example[the To-Do example]
----
(def decisions
  {:collection
   {:get  {:handle-ok (comp tl/todo-lists ed/db)}
    :post {:malformed?     (v/validate-describe v/todo-list-rules)
           :post!          ed/create->:result
           :handle-created ed/created-pull}}})
----

Decision maps are keyed first by route type (see
xref:routes-in-depth.adoc[Routes in Depth] for an explanation of route types),
then by request method. As developers working on RESTful APIs, we categorize
units of work by request method, so I think it's useful to unambiguously
distinguish handlers for different methods.


=== Slightly opinionated default decisions ===
Liberator is very flexible, very cool. You can use it for content negotiation,
for example, serving different responses based on a request's media type and
returning the appropriate HTTP status code when a request's media types don't
match what the server provides. You saw an example of this in the last section:

[source,clojure]
.media types
----
(defresource list-resource
  :available-media-types ["application/json"]
  :known-content-type? #(check-content-type % ["application/json"]))
----

By default, Sweet Tooth endpoints expect to receive and return https://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/7/22/transit[Transit]. It also
has conventions for error handling, expecting errors to be placed under
`:errors` in the context map. Here are all of Sweet Tooth's https://github.com/sweet-tooth-clojure/endpoint/blob/0f0fa42d17e1aef27e7381c3f99e22a25ec0aade/src/sweet_tooth/endpoint/liberator.clj#L102[defaults]:

[source,clojure]
.sweet tooth decision defaults
----
(def decision-defaults
  "A base set of liberator resource decisions"
  (let [errors-in-ctx (fn [ctx] [:errors (:errors ctx)])
        base          {:available-media-types ["application/transit+json"
                                               "application/transit+msgpack"
                                               "application/json"]
                       :allowed-methods       [:get]
                       :authorized?           true
                       :handle-unauthorized   errors-in-ctx
                       :handle-malformed      errors-in-ctx
                       :respond-with-entity?  true
                       :new?                  false}]
    {:get    base
     :post   (merge base {:allowed-methods [:post]
                          :new?            true
                          :handle-created  record})
     :put    (merge base {:allowed-methods [:put]})
     :patch  (merge base {:allowed-methods [:patch]})
     :head   (merge base {:allowed-methods [:head]})
     :delete (merge base {:allowed-methods      [:delete]
                          :respond-with-entity? false})}))
