= Request Handling from the Top Down =
Daniel Higginbotham


This guide describes:

* The components involved in handling a requset
* The relationships between the components
* How duct composes the components
* How a request flows through the components


== Components ==
Check out my very beautiful diagram of the components involved in handling an
API request:

.wow a very well drawn architectural diagram

* A request is sent across the internet until it reaches a _machine_ (1).
* The machine is running a _database_ (2). I drew this to kinda look like home
base in baseball, but also to kinda look like a house filled with stuff. Data
stuff.
* _HTTP server_ (3). An HTTP server is just a process that listens for requests
on a port (typically 80 or 443) and sends responses. HTTP servers are
cylinders.
* The HTTP server contains a _database connection_ (4). I drew that as an arrow
because it uh points to a database.
* The HTTP server also contains a _request handler_ (5). In Clojure, this is a
function. That's why I used a lambda symbol. The lambda is kinda droopy
because it's sick. Not that kind of sick; I mean _sick_ üòéüèç.
* The request handler is comprised of a _middleware stack_ (6) and a _router_
(7).
* You can think of the router has a lookup table mapping request methods and
path patterns to _endpoint handlers_. Endpoint handlers are just functions.
Many endpoint handlers will have references to the database connection (8).

Some more notes on this setup:

* There are different libraries for creating HTTP request handlers, including
Pedestal and Ring. Sweet Tooth uses Ring. The HTTP server ultimately doesn't care.


// ^

* a machine has a database
* a machine has a server, a running process
* the server has a connection to the database
* the server has a request handler, a function
* the request handler has a middleware stack, transforming requests
* the request handler also has a router, a function. also called a handler
* the router can be thought of as a table
* a router routes requests to an endpoint handler, another function
* endpoint handlers reference the db connection

a flat config that composes these relationships

components mean there's an expected interface

components are interchangeable

you have to include the route table in the configuration
